# TeenyBreaks.com Menubar

Science-based tips for mindful breaks, now also in your menubar.

Based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), works on all platforms.

**This project is great for first-timers looking to publish their first open source contributions, or for anyone that wants to learn how to build their own cross-platform menubar application in almost no time with HTML/CSS/JS via Electron.**

## Usage

1. Install [Node.js LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Make sure npm is updated: `npm i -g npm`.
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sebastienvercammen/electron-teenybreaks-menubar.git`.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Build the project: `npm run build`.

## Building the project

To keep things simple, we use [electron-forge](https://electronforge.io/). It builds the project for the architecture you're currently using.

More `npm` scripts can be added to support building the project for different platforms or achitectures.
